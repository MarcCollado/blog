This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com) project.

Here you will find whatever I am currently doing, reading, learning, building... and keeps me awake at night, timely updated every now and then.

## 📚 Reading

- [Super Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525533583/)
- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics I](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465024939/)

## 🏗 Building

- [LEGO NASA Apollo Saturn V](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-nasa-apollo-saturn-v-21309)
- [Safareig.fm](https://www.safareig.fm)

## 💭 Pondering

- Are NFTs the first attempt to build the so-called Metaverse underlying infrastructure?
- Is there a place for a flourishing middle class in the creator space? If so, how would you architect a platform to nurture it?
  - Can models such as Brave w/ BAT be implemented to reward interaction while allowing creators to have a stake and vested interest in your platform?
- With the rise of in-the-moment content (Locker Room, Clubhouse...), do in-depth, long-form, and insightful mediums still stand a chance?
