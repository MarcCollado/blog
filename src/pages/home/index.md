## My Story In a Few Paragraphs
Born and raised in Barcelona. I am an Industrial Engineer, always involved with tech products and companies.

In 2011, upon graduation, co-founded [iomando technologies](/iomando), a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. Which in plain English means opening doors and stuff with your phone. We built a [cool product](/iomando) and ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com/) in 2017.

In 2015, decided to [switch gears](/blog/2015/stepping-down) and pursue another passion of mine: [education](/tags/education). Then joined [Ironhack](/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology. First as the GM in Barcelona, establishing the city operations from the ground up, and later on as Product Manager.

As you can see, I like simple, starting things from scratch, and devote almost all my free time to [read books](/books), [learn new stuff](/blog/2018/udacity-dand) and [build](https://github.com/MarcCollado), mostly, useless things.


## Other Irrelevant Things
* Hold [strong opinions](/tags/opinion) on [well-being](/tags/health) and [happiness](/tags/happiness), [simple living](/tags/simple) and [products](/tags/product) in general.
* [Engineering](/tags/coding), [craftsmanship](/tags/craft), [history](/tags/history) and [physics](/tags/physics) have all my attention.
* Couldn't agree more with idea that *"we don't see things as they are"* that we actually *"see them as we are"*.
* Love things that [move around](/tags/transport): bikes, cars, trains, planes, you name it.
* Know for a fact that any mindless activity gets much better by listening to a podcast.
* Do not like to travel, I truly believe it is overrated, but I'd definitely go for a tour around the world just to see amazing factories.
