In 2015, after a short-lived, [failed attempt](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) to take a sabbatical, I decided to switch gears and pursue [another passion of mine](/tags/education) and joined [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) to change the way we learn about technology. First as the Campus Manager in Barcelona, establishing the city operations from the ground up, and later on as a Product Manager.
