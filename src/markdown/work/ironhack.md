In 2015, after an unsuccessful attempt at taking a sabbatical, decided to switch gears and joined [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) to change the way we learn about technology

First as the [Campus Manager in Barcelona](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) — establishing the city operations from the ground up.

Later on, in 2017, in my quest for starting things from scratch, I took the challenge of [setting up the global product team at Ironhack](/blog/2017/back-to-product) — where I currently work as Product Manager.
