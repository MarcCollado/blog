In 2020, [after almost five years](/blog/2020/thank-you-and-goodbye-ironhack) of pure Ironhack delight — first [establishing Barcelona' operations](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) from the ground up; then later on, in 2017, [setting up the global product team](/blog/2017/back-to-product) — it was about time for me to retreat back to the very definition of early stage.

Gamestry has allowed me to help countless players improve their gaming skills. We've achieved such a feat through an Esports platform for pro coaches to publish engaging and educational material; creating a healthy community of learners, and ultimately turning their passion for games into a sustainable lifestyle.
