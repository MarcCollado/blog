Despite _work_ doesn't fully capture the essence of this page â€” since it aims to showcase both companies I've been professionally involved with, but also random side projects of mine â€” I must admit, I couldn't find a better signifier.

Before you jump in though, here's a little bit of context on some of the projects:

- iomando: in 2011, upon graduating from college, I co-founded iomando technologies â€” a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. We built a really cool product and ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://www.citibox.com/) in late 2017, which integrated iomando's technology into their core product â€” the smart mailboxes
- Ironhack: in 2015, after a short-lived, [failed attempt](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) to take a sabbatical, I decided to switch gears and pursue [another passion of mine](/tags/education) and joined [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) to change the way we learn about technology. First as the Campus Manager in Barcelona, establishing the city operations from the ground up, and later on as a Product Manager.
