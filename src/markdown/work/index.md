Hello there!

Welcome to the new, yet under construction, work page â€” and sorry if this is not exactly what you were expecting ðŸ˜•

You know, this website has been hosted elsewhere for more than five years, and just recently decided to tear everything apart and rebuild the thing from scratch ðŸ”¥ if you're curious about the reasons why I wanted to throw this misery onto my own existence, you can read the whole story [in here](/blog/2018/moving-collado-io).

But moving on, what to do now?

First of all, stay calm, and keep in mind that during the transition all the content is still live at [collado.squarespace.com](https://collado.squarespace.com/) and I've tried to honor the URL mappings. So, if you get a nice 404, most of the time, just changing the root domain and maintaining the URL should do the trick.

Then, knowing that, I've got three options for you:

1. I've put together kind of a [first aid kit](/blog/2018/collado-io-live) to navigate the place. If you have the time and the patience, it just takes two minutes to read and it will provide a little bit of guidance.
2. If I assume you came here to know more about iomando (this is precisely one of the pages that I'm currently working on), since it was one of the most visited pages at collado.io. Your best option then is definitely to go to [collado.squarespace.com/iomando](https://collado.squarespace.com/iomando)).
3. Otherwise, you should be fine, just remember that all the old content is still live at [collado.squarespace.com](https://collado.squarespace.com/), and if you behave properly and follow only links on the page, it will all work ðŸ˜ƒ

Again, sorry for the inconvenience and I hope next time you come back this is all up and running ðŸš€
