Radio Lanza is a podcast co-hosted by Jimmy Flores & Marc Collado, where we share our personal experiences on how to launch your own business idea â€” so we can help our audience avoid the mistakes we've made.

A show that wants to inspire and encourage our listeners to launch their new projects. It is also an excuse for us to geek out on a weekly basis. Interviewing amazing guests, dissecting hot topics, but above all, sharing our strong, controversial opinions around the products we love.
