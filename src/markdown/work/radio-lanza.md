Radio Lanza is a podcast co-hosted by Jimmy Flores & Marc Collado. In each episode we share our personal experiences on how to launch your own business idea â€” so we can guide and help our audience avoid the mistakes we've made.

In a nutshell, a show that wants to inspire and encourage our listeners to launch their new projects. But also an excuse for us to geek out on a weekly basis. Interviewing amazing guests, dissecting hot topics, but above all, sharing our strong, controversial opinions around the products we love.
