excerpt: 'Keyless access management for mobile devices'

In 2011, inadvertently, I became an entrepreneur. Upon graduating from college, a random idea led me to co-found iomando technologies — a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. Which in plain English means opening doors and other stuff with your phone.

Late in 2017, the company ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://www.citibox.com/), that integrated iomando's technology into their core product — the smart mailboxes.
