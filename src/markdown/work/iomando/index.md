In 2011 iomando pioneered keyless access management for mobile devices. Which in plain English means opening doors and other stuff with your phone. Late in 2017, the company ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://www.citibox.com/), that integrated iomando's technology into their core product â€” the smart mailboxes.
