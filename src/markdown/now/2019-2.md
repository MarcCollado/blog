This Now chapter for Mid 2019 features a brand new Learning section ðŸ¤“, but long story short, the themes are Stalder Press, pansa, books at collado.io, physics and more conscious reading.

## Training

After [sunsetting the sub3 project](/blog/2019/sunsetting-sub3) ([again](/blog/2018/going-sub3)), my training-related efforts have shifted towards mobility, flexibility and strength.

My goal for this Mid 2019 is "as easy" (and measurable) as being able to [perform a strict Stalder Press to Handstad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtfKAn4UTOc).

For the first time, I really don't have a clue where I'm getting into. Even if it is possible ðŸ˜…, but as always, I'll do my best and, in the end, report the results.

## Making

During the lasts months [I couldn't allocate as much time as I wanted](/blog/2019/strong-opinions-loosely-held) to [pansa](/work/pansa). Consequently, [the project has stalled](https://github.com/MarcCollado/pansa). Nonetheless, I want to continue working on it, since I truly believe such a product needs to exist.

Somehow related to pansa and knowledge collection, I will be [revamping the way book summaries are presented at collado.io](/blog/2019/upgrading-books). Writing quick summaries out of my notes after reading a book is a good habit of mine. I want to make the most out of this content, so readers can benefit from a better experience.

## Learning

Despite I'm actively seeking for new schemes to keep on learning, every year I try to enroll a (more structured) course around a topic I'd like to go deeper. Here are examples from [2016](/blog/2016/ironhack-experience), [2017](/blog/2018/udacity-dand) and [2018](/blog/2018/udacity-rdnd).

This year, though, "I don't feel like course". Yet there is a topic I want to explore further: physics.

Back in college, I hated physics. Nowadays I find myself devouring books, papers, or [anything I can put my hands on](https://brilliant.org), that speaks physics. Several friends have recommended the [Feynmann Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu) â€” I will (re)start my structured physics journey with them.

## Reading

> If you've read a book in a week, you haven't "read it", at all.

This was a friend's reaction when I mentioned I was aiming to read a couple of books per month during Early 2019. Then he went on...

> You don't go cover to cover and call it a day. A book is not a closed entity living in isolation. It contains a mesh of references you ought to explore, endless opportunities to learn beyond the book itself. It should persuade you to discover new ideas, otherwise, you are not truly "reading it".

...and he has a point.

For this reason, during Mid 2019, I will slow down my reading efforts and focus more on "reading" the ones I couldn't handle from Early 2019. Plus I will revisit my all-time favorite [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062316095/), but embracing this mindful approach, savoring each page ðŸ˜‹
