TikTok is a fascinating product — as well as a source of inspiration — that has mastered the relation between the creation and distribution of its content. On the creation side, it is making what used to be pro workflows, very accessible and easy to use. On the distribution side, it is enabling its algorithm through both human-assisted tagging and direct user feedback.

## The creator

TikTok makes, what used to be pro workflows, very accessible and easy to use. Things like effects, editing music... are effortlessly available to creators. A lot of people ask why YouTube hasn't already tackled this opportunity. This is something [we are quite familiar with at Gamestry](/blog/2020/creators-are-struggling). YouTube has become so vast that it can't create vertical experiences that fit each use case on the platform.

Network effects on creativity: how each creator makes others more creative.

- Bypassing the blank canvas: start by remixing others' ideas, make duets, re-use other videos as "components".
- Distribution: instead of creating content "in the dark", know how to be promoted through featured challenges or trending hashtags.

Update: I wrote an entire post about how to [retain and help creators thrive within your product](/blog/2020/creators-go-first).

- [ ] ✍️ How do you retain a creator — or have exclusive content? How do you differentiate, protect, and make your business unique? A distinct feature that nobody can replicate.
  - Producing your own content — aka. Netflix.
  - You've got a specific feature (creator tools) where a piece of content "only makes sense" within your platform — aka. TikTok remixes, or Spotify with the ability to mix music with podcast (commenting on songs).
  - Somewhat related to the previous one, Twitch has a similar feature but around "culture".
  - Offering something.
- [ ] ✍️ Vision: a place where any creator can make a living out of their passion.
  - Recommendation engine.
  - Creator and community tools.
  - Innovation around monetization
