TikTok is a fascinating product, as well as a [source of inspiration](/blog/2020/notes-tiktok) of mine,Â that has mastered the relation between creation and distribution of its content. On the creator side, it is making what used to be pro workflows accessible and easy to use. On distribution, it is [enabling its algorithm](/blog/2020/distribution-matters) through both human-assisted tagging and direct user feedback.

In this post I want to focus on the former.

The fact that TikTok has attracted so many creators to its platform is not fortuitous. This trend is partly driven by its ability to democratizing pro niches and making them approachable to the _rest of us_. Features reserved to the most sophisticated power users, such as complicated video effects or audio editing, are now effortlessly available to creators.

This "simple" twist to the editing toolkit makes all the difference. It doesn't just foster content creation, but, most important, it unlocks network effects on creativity. In other words, the addition of an additional creator spurs inspiration across the board, by making others even more innovative and resourcefulness.

Since [creators are struggling](/blog/2020/creators-are-struggling) to find a place in the Internet that connects them to their audience, a lot of people has asked why [YouTube hasn't tackled this opportunity](/blog/2020/youtube-wont-work). However, YouTube has become so vast that its priorities aren't set by niches anymore. Its product is embracing an unimaginably broad array of realities that it can't optimize vertical experiences that fit each use case on the platform.

The bad news is that this ossification turns them into the default choice for most creators. On the bright side, though, it presents an opportunity for emerging platforms to exploit _small_ niches with massive upside that are still irrelevant for them to tackle.
