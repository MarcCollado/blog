## Me, in a bullet list

Family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

- 🎓 Industrial engineer by trade, entrepreneur by accident.
- 🤹‍♂️ Product enthusiast, data nerd, programmer aficionado.
- 🤓 Lifelong learner, confessed minimalist.
- 🏃‍♂️ Committed athlete, aspiring bicycle mechanic.

### Now, in a timeline

- 2011: upon graduating from college, accidentally [co-founded iomando technologies](/work/iomando) — a tech startup pioneering access management for mobile that ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com).
- 2015: switched gears and [joined Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology — [establishing the city operations](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) from the ground up.
- 2017: in my quest for starting things from scratch, took the challenge of [setting up the global product team at Ironhack](/blog/2017/back-to-product).
- 2020: retreated back to the very definition of early stage and kickstarted [Gamestry](/work/gamestry) to build an educational product for the nascent Esports community.
- Up next: lining up the next move, which might involve a 🏡 small cottage in the countryside, far from the city, 👨‍🌾 farming, and 🐮 livestock.

### Other than that

I lead a rather simple, uncomplicated life, and spend my days 📚 [reading](/tags/books), ✍️ [writing](/blog), 🚴‍♂️ [exercising](https://www.strava.com/athletes/marccollado), and 🏗 [building](/work) things.
