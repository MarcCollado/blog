Hello 👋 I'm Marc — a family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

An Industrial Engineer by trade, when I was pretty young, I unexpectedly [became an entrepreneur](/work/iomando). Which led me to learn how to code and a love for creating new things.

I've since remained a programmer aficionado. However, curiosity has taken me [all over the place](/work).

Other than that, I lead a rather minimal life. One that I strive — but not always succeed — to optimize for happiness.

Happiness, I found, is influenced by simple ideas: getting enough sleep, moving around, learning new things, eating well, or connecting with people.

When these habits become routine, days usually look like 📚 [reading](/books), ✍️ [writing](/blog), 🏃‍♂️ [exercising](https://www.strava.com/athletes/marccollado), and 🏗 [building](/work/gamestry).

To know more about what I am currently up to, check out my [now page](/now), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/) project.
