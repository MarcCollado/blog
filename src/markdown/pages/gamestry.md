In 2020, [after almost five years](/blog/2020/thank-you-and-goodbye-ironhack) of pure Ironhack delight ‚Äî first [establishing Barcelona' operations](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) from the ground up; then later on, in 2017, [setting up the global product team](/blog/2017/back-to-product) ‚Äî it was about time for me to retreat back (again) to the very definition of early stage.

This time around the leap was even more challenging: it was not only an industry (gaming) I knew nothing about but also a type of product (online video platform) that I had never dealt with before.

Kick-starting a product from "nada" is always a daring endeavor. However, building something that has never been tried before on top of
emergent grounds ‚Äî such as Esports ‚Äî makes things even more
exhilarating.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Highlights

- Joined as early as employee #1 to "define" Gamestry's product
- Built and launched the first version of the product ‚Äî¬†which I coded by myself
- Hired, scaled, and led both the product and engineering teams
- Raised a seed round of 500.000‚Ç¨ with local angels and early-stage funds
- Went from 0 to 2 million MAUs (as of December 2020), growing almost 100% MoM

## üóÉ (Even) more Gamestry

Gamestry is a video platform made for creators where they can make a living out of their passion. A place designed and optimized around and only for gamers. Below you'll find the posts I've been writing about industry insights and also the experience of building the product.
