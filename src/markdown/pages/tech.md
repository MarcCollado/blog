Lists are (the most) elegant systems for bookmarking ideas. They are entropy reducers by design. The peace of mind that you've captured a random set of items. One line at a time, they convey structure, grouping, and hierarchy.

Some lists, however, especially [those that aim to pin down bottomless wells of information](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), might evoque stress instead of achieving this aforementioned state of tranquility.

For example, lists that point to [all there is to learn](https://roadmap.sh) when it comes to programming can be discouraging. They undercover all there is to master, or, how much you still don't know.

To tackle my own anxieties, I decided to list (and maintain) all the tech and tools I'm familiar with and currently use in my projects.
