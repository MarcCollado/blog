Since the very beginning, I've been lucky enough to _work_ on what I love.

Professionally, I've always been involved with tech and startups. As a founder, leading product teams, or hands-down programming, I've seen the early stage from every angle.

This has "granted access" to _work_ within fast-growing environments, amazing products, and remarkable teams. However, it has also rendered me ~~unqualified~~ unemployable at a 9 to 5 job 👨‍💼.

Despite _work_ doesn't capture the essence of this page, it aims to showcase both companies I've been involved with, but also random side-projects of mine.
