[Radio Lanza](https://www.radiolanza.com) is a podcast co-hosted by Jimmy Flores & Marc Collado. In each episode we share our personal experiences on how to go about your next business idea â€” so we can guide and help our audience avoid the mistakes we've made.

In a nutshell, a show that wants to inspire and encourage our listeners to launch their new projects. But also an excuse for us to geek out weekly. Interviewing amazing guests, dissecting hot topics, but above all, sharing our strong, controversial opinions around the products we love.

## ðŸ—ƒ (Even) more Radio Lanza

Readers familiar with Radio Lanza know that I derive almost as much pleasure curating the show notes as I do co-hosting the podcast. Maybe the whole podcast venture is just an excuse to write down and structure our own words in a bullet point fashion.

You can read the show notes on [our official website](https://www.radiolanza.com), but also below you'll find a series of posts covering announcements, ideas, and updates around the podcast itself.
