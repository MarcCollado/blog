## Here's me, in a bullet list

Family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

- 🎓 Industrial engineer by trade, entrepreneur by accident
- 🤹‍♂️ Developer in the works, former product manager
- 🤓 Lifelong learner, confessed minimalist
- 🏃‍♂️ Athlete aficionado, aspiring bike mechanic

### And here's me, in a timeline

- 2011: upon graduating from college, accidentally [co-founded iomando technologies](/work/iomando) — a tech startup pioneering access management for mobile that ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com).
- 2015: decided to switch gears and [joined Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology — [establishing the city operations](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) from the ground up.
- 2017: in my quest for starting things from scratch, I took the challenge of [setting up the global product team at Ironhack](/blog/2017/back-to-product).
- 2020: after almost 10 years of hesitation, at the age of 32, I finally did it. I made the leap, and kicked off my career as full-stack web developer at [Gamestry](/work/gamestry).
- 202\_\_: currently lining up the next move, which might involve a 🏡 small cottage, far from the city, 👨‍🌾 farming, and 🐮 livestock. We'll see...

## Other than that

My life is rather predictable: I devote almost all my free time to 📚 [reading](/tags/books), ✍️ [writing](/blog), 🎙️ [podcasting](/work/radio-lanza), and 🏗 [building](/work) things.
