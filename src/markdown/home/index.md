## Me, In A Bullet List

Quiet, family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

- 🎓 Industrial engineer
- 🤹‍♂️ Devoted product manager
- 👨‍💻 Programmer aficionado
- 🏃‍♂️ Avid runner
- 🤓 Lifelong learner

## What I've Been Up To

- In 2011, upon graduating from college, co-founded [iomando technologies](/work/iomando) — a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices that ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com).
- In 2015, decided to switch gears and pursue another [passion of mine](/tags/education/) and joined [Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology — establishing the city operations from the ground up.

## Other Than That

I devote almost all my free time to 📚 [reading](/tags/books) books and 🏗 [building](/work/pansa), mostly, useless things.

`PRO TIP`: if you want to know what I am currently up to, check out my [now page](/now), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/) project.
