## My Story In a Few Paragraphs
Born and raised in Barcelona, I am an [Industrial Engineer](/blog/2013/industrial-engineer) by trade, always involved with startups and [tech](/tags/tech) products.

In 2011, right upon graduation, co-founded [iomando technologies](/work/iomando), a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. Which in plain English means opening doors and stuff with your phone. We built a [really cool product](/work/iomando) and ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com/) in late 2017.

In 2015, though, I decided to [switch gears](/blog/2015/stepping-down) and pursue another passion of mine: [education](/tags/education). Then [joined Ironhack](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology. First as the [Campus Manager](/blog/2017/ironhack-gm) in Barcelona, establishing the city operations from the ground up, and later on as a [Product Manager](/blog/2017/ironhack-from-gm-to-pm).

As you can see, I like starting things from scratch. Other than that, I devote almost all my free time to [reading](/books), [training](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1113999), and [building](https://github.com/MarcCollado), mostly, useless things.

## Other Irrelevant Things
* Hold [strong opinions](/tags/idea) on [well-being](/tags/health) and [happiness](/tags/happiness), [simple living](/tags/simplicity) and [products](/tags/product) in general.
* Anything that has to do with good [engineering](/tags/coding), [craftsmanship](/tags/craft), [physics](/tags/physics), [history](/tags/history) or [human behavior](/tags/psychology), has all my attention.
* Couldn't agree more with AnaÃ¯s Nin idea that *"we don't see things as they are"* that we actually *"see them as we are"*.
* Love stuff that [moves around](/tags/transport): bikes, cars, trains, planes, you name it.
* Know for a fact that any mindless activity gets much better by listening to a podcast.
* Do not like to travel, I truly believe it is overrated, but I'd definitely tour around the world just to see amazing factories.
