## A Few Things About Me
Quiet, family guy, born and raised in Barcelona, always been involved with technology and products.

* Industrial engineer by trade
* [Product manager](https://linkedin.com/in/marccollado) by day
* [Programmer aficionado](https://github.com/MarcCollado) by night

I like to [build stuff](/work/pansa) ‚Äî and lists! ‚Äî that's what I do, most of the time.

These ‚òùÔ∏è sentences just got you a quite accurate picture of me ‚Äî 80/20 at its best. But, please, let me grab a little bit more of your attention, so I can formally üëî show you (in a couple of nicely formatted bullet points) what I've been doing these lasts years.

* In 2011, upon graduating from college, I co-founded [iomando technologies](/work/iomando) ‚Äî a startup pioneering keyless access management for mobile devices. We built a really cool product and ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com/) in late 2017, which integrated iomando's technology into their smart mailbox product line.
* In 2015, after a short-lived, failed attempt to take a sabbatical, I decided to switch gears and pursue another passion of mine: [education](/tags/education). Then joined [Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology. First as the Campus Manager in Barcelona, establishing the city operations from the ground up, and later on as a Product Manager.

But other than that, I devote almost all my free time to [reading books](/tags/books), [training](https://www.strava.com/athletes/marccollado), and [building](https://github.com/MarcCollado), mostly, useless things.

ü§ì **`PRO TIP:`** if you want to know what I am currently up to, check out my [now page](https://collado-io.netlify.com/now), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/) project.


### I strongly believe that...
* Any mindless activity inevitably gets better by listening to a podcast.
* GitHub' Contributions and Strava' Training Log are the modern manifestation of *mens sana in corpore sano*.

### You should know that...
* When I was a kid I knew by heart literally every single car spec listed at the end of cars' magazines.
  * I suspect this might have something to do with me spending more time than I'd like to admit messing around with car configurators ‚Äî definitely one of my guilty pleasures.
  * Despite my unconditional love to means of transportation, I would never own a car.
* Because of iomando, I was featured in the *30 Under 30* list by Entrepreneur ‚Äî I've been told that it is ok to "brag" about it once you are old enough that you can't be awarded again.
