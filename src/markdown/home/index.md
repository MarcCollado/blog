## Me, in a bullet list

Quiet, family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

- 🎓 Industrial engineer by trade, entrepreneur by accident
- 🤹‍♂️ Former product manager, turned into web developer
- 🤓 First principles thinker, lifelong learner
- 🏃‍♂️ Athlete aficionado, ice cream lover

## If you are more into timelines

- 2011: upon graduating from college, accidentally [co-founded iomando technologies](/work/iomando) — a tech startup pioneering access management for mobile that ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com).
- 2015: decided to switch gears and [joined Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology — [establishing the city operations](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack) from the ground up.
- 2017: in my quest for starting things from scratch, I took the challenge of [setting up the global product team at Ironhack](/blog/2017/back-to-product) and worked as a Product Manager.

## Other Than That

I devote almost all my free time to 📚 [reading](/tags/books), ✍️ [writing](/blog), 🎙️ [podcasting](/work/radio-lanza), and 🏗 [building](/work) things.
