## Me, in a bullet list

Quiet, family guy, born and raised in Barcelona.

- 🎓 Industrial engineer by trade, entrepreneur by accident
- 🤹‍♂️ Devoted product manager, confessed list maker
- 👨‍💻 Technology enthusiast, programmer aficionado
- 🤓 First principles thinker, lifelong learner
- 🏃‍♂️ Intermittent runner, ice cream lover

## If you are more into timelines

- In 2011, upon graduating from college, [accidentally co-founded iomando technologies](/work/iomando) — a tech startup pioneering access management for mobile that ended up acquired by [Citibox](https://citibox.com).
- In 2015, [after an unsuccessful attempt at taking a sabbatical](/blog/2015/hi-from-ironhack), decided to switch gears and joined [Ironhack](/work/ironhack) to change the way we learn about technology — establishing the city operations from the ground up.
- In 2017, again, in my quest for starting things from scratch, I took the challenge of setting up the global product team at Ironhack — where I currently work as a product manager.

## Other Than That

...and since I don't like to travel, I devote almost all my free time to ✍️ [writing](/blog), 📚 [reading](/tags/books), both 🎧 listening and 🎙️ [co-hosting](/work/radio-lanza) podcasts, and 🏗 [building](/work), mostly, useless things.

If you want to know what I am currently up to, check out my [now page](/now), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://twitter.com/sivers) and the [nownownow](https://nownownow.com/) project.
