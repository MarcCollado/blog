ℹ️ If you are more into podcasts, check out the audio (and extended) version of this post in our [first episode of 2020](/work/radio-lanza/episodes/20). On top of that, keep in mind this post is also the natural extension of the [2019 retrospective](/blog/2019/retrospective). Which, in itself, was the audio, TL;DR version of [the last episode of 2019](/work/radio-lanza/episodes/19), where Jimmy and I put together our reviews of the closing year. And yes, that was quite a lot of resolution follow up!

This post also changes the 4-month Now schedule pattern (early, mid, late) seen in past editions, in favor of a one-off Now, published at the beginning of each year. As progress is being made, the items across resolutions will be properly updated. By the end of the year, I also plan in releasing a retrospective, similar to [this one I wrote for 2019](/blog/2019/retrospective).

TL;DR: this year's theme will be all about consolidating the [career transition as a web developer](/blog/2020/craft). All the efforts will be focused on mastering JavaScript from the ground up, learning computer science fundamentals, embracing best practices, and getting a deeper understanding of the tools and techniques that comprise the full stack.

## Career — 💶 MYM

- Read these 5 books:
  - Eloquent JavaScript
  - Clean Code
  - Clean Architecture
  - Structure and interpretation of computer programs
  - The pragmatic programmer
- Enroll and complete the [CS50 — Computer Science for Web Programming](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-web-programming) — starts on the 1st of April.
- Invest more time to side-projects:
  - collado.io: finish the migration and write 25 articles.
  - Radio Lanza: find a "niche" and record 25 episodes.

## Body — 🏋️‍♂️ MYF

- Keep a more consistent [training log](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1113999/training/log) by exercising every single day:
  - 🏃‍♂️ Run 2.000 km
  - 🚴 Bike 3.000 km — from the 1st of April until the 31st of October

## Mind — 🐮 MYW

- Double down: read 25 (non-CS) books.

## The not to-do list

Things that I'd also like to do in 2020, but won't. They still remain potential candidates for 2021.

- Add meditation to the daily routine.
- Keep a more diverse training log by adding swimming to the mix.
