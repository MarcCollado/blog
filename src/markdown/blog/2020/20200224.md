> All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

—— [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal)

Our minds are over-stimulated and our bodies over-fed, under-exercised. Meditation, exercise, and fasting could restore an ancient balance.

## Mind

🧘 Be present: this moment is a gift, that's why we call it present.

This very moment is all there is. Our minds are constantly expecting something, worrying about the future, or regretting from the past. We pay money and buy things just to escape the present, to "take us out".

Yet to be happy is no more than accepting our reality. Being aware of our thoughts. Embracing the now.It doesn't matter how "good or bad" it is. We are in control and we'll make it the best of what we have.

> Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.

—— [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy)

Aim to see the world as an artist would. Ask questions. Be curious. Be fascinated and let the smallest things surprise you.

📥 Limit inputs: the quality of your output is a direct function of the sources you allow in.

We are bombarded with information, most of it, unimportant, irrelevant. Society is constantly pushing information at us, creating a sense of urgency along the way. We fool ourselves with the importance of the urgent. [We lose the sense of the truth](/blog/2019/attention-deprived). We call it "analysis by paralysis". Something we've known for a long time to be used in wars, conflicts, and whenever we seek to instill caos and confusion.

> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.

—— [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon)

The only outcome of this behavior is lack of focus on what truly matters. If we instead seek to limit our inputs to be, not just fewer, but of the [highest quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect), we'd become a mile deep in what really matter.

Go back to the classics: by limiting input and making sure it is of the highest quality, we'd be only consuming information that has already endured the test of time. We'd be automatically filtering the signal from the noise.

There are countless of events happening right now, at this very moment, around the world. 99.9% of them do not matter now and won't certainly matter in the future. However, our technology makes possible to surface and let each of them be potentially forwarded to us. This is a problem because have come to convince ourselves that [we need to be ever present](/blog/2016/little-hacks) in order to filter out this 0.1%.

In other (simpler) words: shut down social media, batch texting and email, [get rid of unnecessary screens](/blog/2019/leapfrogging-the-phone). Don't be afraid of missing out, whatever is important today, we'll remain important tomorrow.

🤫 Afraid of silence: we live endlessly connected to irrelevant chatter and noises because we prefer to keep our minds distracted rather than sitting quietly with our thoughts.

> We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.

—— Epictetus

🏛️ Seek wisdom: put yourself in an endless path of open minded search for the truth.

All intellectual movements, religions, or philosophies, have just one thing in common: they seek wisdom. [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius) suggested "a craftsman approach to wisdom". The greeks referred to it as [Sophia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(wisdom)>). The Buddhists coined the term [Prajñā](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajñā_(Buddhism)>). Even the Bible has a citation around it.

> The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.

—— Proverbs 4:7

So, no matter what is your religious flavor of choice, if you aim to seek wisdom you'd most certainly "get it right". As a gateway to wisdom, the book also recommends to cultivate the habit of journaling.
