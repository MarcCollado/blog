> Changes that seem small and unimportant at first, will compound into remarkable results if you stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives will depend on the quality of our habits. With the same habits you will end up with the same results, but with better habits, everything is possible.

## Habits Compound

> Get 1 percent better each day for one year, you‚Äôll end up thirty-seven times better.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. You can't see any difference in a single change, but the impact in the long run can be enormous.

üìç Aggregation of marginal gains: searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

It cuts both ways though, we often dismiss small changes because they don‚Äôt seem to matter very much in the moment, and we find it easier to fall back to the bad habit because of its immediate reward. This idea can be also found in [Better Than Before](/blog/2018/better-than-before).

Same applies to negative habits. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn‚Äôt move much. But our small choices compound into toxic results. It‚Äôs the accumulation of many missteps.

> Choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.

It is not where are we standing right now (current results), it is the path we are on (current trajectory) that matters.

Under this framework, it is time that magnifies the margin between success and failure. It multiplies whatever you feed it, either good or bad.

## One Defining Moment ‚Äî The Illusion Of Success

Because the outside world just sees a dramatic event, not all the work that preceded it, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. It's easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

> You get what you repeat.

Breakthrough moments are usually the result of several previous actions, which build up the requirements to unleash a major change.

üìç Plateau of latent potential: despite you expect to make progress in a linear fashion, habits appear to make no difference until they cross a certain threshold. It is a hallmark of any compounding process, the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

Like ice melting when crossing a certain temperature, the work was not wasted, it is just being stored.

Once the Plateau of latent potential is crossed, people will call it "overnight success", reinforcing the idea of survivorship bias.

This problem we have with non-linearity and compounding effects is also explored in [Fooled By Randomness](/blog/2019/fooled-by-randomness) and the idea that "most people give up before the rewards".

## Goals & Systems

- Goals are about the results you want to achieve, they are good for setting direction.
- Systems are about the process that lead to those results, they are best for making progress.

> A systems-first mentality beats a goal-oriented mind-set.

There are several problems associated with goal-setting:

- Winners and losers share the same goals, thus the goals are not what differentiate them. It is the systems in place what leads to a desired outcome.
- A goal is a momentary change ‚Äî achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. Rather focus on fixing the inputs and the outputs will take care of themselves.
- Goals restrict happiness: first, they foster the idea of [Hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill), because you're continuously defering happiness until the next milestone (when I have `X` I'll be happy). Second, it also allocates success to the binary resolution of achieving it or not.
- Goals are at odds with long term progress: runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. In other words, people revert their habits once the goal has been accomplished.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?

> Fall in love with the process rather than the product.

- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game.
- The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

## Changing The Wrong Thing ‚Äî Identity

Change can happen at three layers:

- Outcomes: goals, what you get.
- Process: systems, what you do.
- Identity: what you believe.

As seen in the previous point, we shouldn't focus on what we want to achieve (outcomes-based), rather on who we wish to become (identity-based).

> The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes your identity.

Behind every system of action, there is a system of beliefs. Consequently, behavior that is not aligned with the self, won't last. If you want to create new habits, you need to change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.

If you want habits to stick in the long term, they have to become part of who you are. You are not the person who "WANTS" or "DOES", you are the person who "IS".

> The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity behind that behavior.

‚ÄúIdentity‚Äù derives from the Latin ‚Äúessentitas‚Äù which means _being_, and ‚Äúidentidem‚Äù, which means _repeatedly_.

Define what you want to be, who you wish to become, then be the type of person that could get the outcome you want.

## 1st Law ‚Äî Make It Obvious

> A habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.

Some people associate habits with lack of freedom, yet the opposite is true, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges.

There are four stages when it comes to creating a habit ‚Äî of any kind:

1. Cue: the trigger that sparks a craving. Same cues might have different effects on different people, depending on their backgrounds or motivations ‚Äî i.e. the sound of a slot machine to a gambler.
2. Craving: the feeling that motivates you to act and generate a response.
3. Response: which provides a reward.
4. Reward: it satisfies the craving, closing the loop, and ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.

If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. That being said, there are ways to reinforce or avoid this loop from happening, depending on the nature of the habit.

Create or reinforce a good habit:

1. Cue: make it obvious.
2. Craving: make it attractive.
3. Response: make it easy.
4. Reward: make it satisfying.

Break or avoid a bad habit:

1. Cue: make it invisible and your habit will never start.
2. Craving: make it unattractive and you won‚Äôt experience enough motivation to act.
3. Response: make it difficult and you won‚Äôt be able to do it.
4. Reward: make it unsatisfying, if it fails to satisfy your desire, then you‚Äôll have no reason to do it again.

The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. To put in [Thinking Fast And Slow](/blog/2018/thinking-fast-and-slow) terms, they have the ability to move behavior from System 2 to System 1.

Some habits are so deeply ingrained in our nature that the cues that spark them become essentially invisible to us. If an habit becomes mindless, you can't expect to improve it. Because of this, the process of behavior change must begin with awareness.

Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones.

> There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems.

All habits serve you in some way, even the bad ones, which is why you repeat them. In order to asses and distill good habits from bad ones, we should ask ourselves: does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?

### (Positive) Feedback loops

Despite PFL are not mentioned in this chapter, the idea of "Habit Stacking" reminded me of a similar concept also found in [Better Than Before](/blog/2018/better-than-before) ‚Äî which Gretchen Rubin refers to as "IF ‚Äî THEN planning".

üìç When and where: the first important takeaway is that people who make a specific plan for "when" and "where" will perform a new habit are more likely to succeed.

> Some think they lack motivation when they really lack clarity.

Scheduling is important not only because it allocates the time to perform the habit (the when), but also because it provides focus, since it prevents other (less important) activities to get in the way.

üìç Habit stacking: create an implementation intention, it goes like "when situation X arises, I will perform response Y" or "after X happens, I will do Y". Then when the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision, simply follow the plan.

The best way to start this pattern is to map the trigger to a current habit or something you _need_ to do, and link it to something you _want_ to do.

`After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].`

üìç First law of behavior change: make it obvious.

In a nutshell... timing and location have a huge impact on habit formation. That's because you often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing and also choose products not because of what they are, but because of where you are ‚Äî environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.

### Design the environment

Every habit is context-dependent: if you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.

Deliberately designing the environment is one of the most effective ways to control our behavior. At the end of the day we think we are in control of our decisions, but we'd be surprised of how many of our actions are simply determined by the most available option, rather than explicit choice.

Visual cues are the main catalyst of behavior, thus a change in what we see can lead in a change in what you do ‚Äî make the cues obvious.

> If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.

Link habits to particular contexts: think about environment as filled with relationships ‚Äî not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior.

Habits can be easier to change in a new environment because it is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues.

> Be the designer of your world, not a mere consumer of it.

### Self-control

Disciplined people seem not to have more self-control, they just have structured their lives in a way that they don't require heroic will-power or self-control. They simply spend less time in tempting situations.

> The people with the best self-control are usually the ones who need to use it the least.

Practice self-control not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.

Behavior change techniques (such shaming obese people or showing picture of sick lungs to smokers) can back-fire, because they foster the feelings they are trying to numb. If you're not careful about cues, you can provoke the behavior you intend to stop in the first place: you feel bad, then you eat more food, then because you ate junk food you feel worse... it is a downwards spiral.

> You can break a bad habit, but you are unlikely to forget it.

Just the fact of being reminded of the cue, for good or for bad (as seen in the previous example), can lead to fall back into the habit again. This is what Gretchen Rubin described as "Poetic justice":

> Poetic justice of bad habits, the punishment bewailers to fit the crime. The punishment for a bad habit, is the bad habit.

Resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy, because it is difficult to maintain good habits in a negative environment. Self-control is just a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. It is better to reduce the exposure to the cue that triggers it in the first place.

üìç The inversion of the First Law Of Behavior Change (for avoiding bad habits): instead of making it obvious, make it invisible.

### Recap

1. Awareness
2. Behavior intention: when X happens, I will do Y
3. Habit stacking: after X, I will do Y
4. Design the environment
