> Changes that seem small and unimportant at first, will compound into remarkable results if you stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives will depend on the quality of our habits. With the same habits you will end up with the same results, but with better habits, everything is possible.

## Habits Compound

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. You can't see any difference in a single change, but the impact in the long run can be enormous.

📍 Aggregation of marginal gains: searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

It cuts both ways though, we often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment, and we find it easier to fall back to the bad habit because of its immediate reward. This idea can be also found in [Better Than Before](/blog/2018/better-than-before).

Same applies to negative habits. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. But our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps.

> Choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.

It is not where are we standing right now (current results), it is the path we are on (current trajectory) that matters.

Under this framework, it is time that magnifies the margin between success and failure. It multiplies whatever you feed it, either good or bad.

## One Defining Moment — The Illusion Of Success

Because the outside world just sees a dramatic event, not all the work that preceded it, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. It's easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.

> You get what you repeat.

Breakthrough moments are usually the result of several previous actions, which build up the requirements to unleash a major change.

📍 Plateau of latent potential: despite you expect to make progress in a linear fashion, habits appear to make no difference until they cross a certain threshold. It is a hallmark of any compounding process, the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

Like ice melting when crossing a certain temperature, the work was not wasted, it is just being stored.

Once the Plateau of latent potential is crossed, people will call it "overnight success", reinforcing the idea of survivorship bias.

This problem we have with non-linearity and compounding effects is also explored in [Fooled By Randomness](/blog/2019/fooled-by-randomness) and the idea that "most people give up before the rewards".

## Goals & Systems

- Goals are about the results you want to achieve, they are good for setting direction.
- Systems are about the process that lead to those results, they are best for making progress.

> A systems-first mentality beats a goal-oriented mind-set.

There are several problems associated with goal-setting:

- Winners and losers share the same goals, thus the goals are not what differentiate them. It is the systems in place what leads to a desired outcome.
- A goal is a momentary change — achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. Rather focus on fixing the inputs and the outputs will take care of themselves.
- Goals restrict happiness: first, they foster the idea of [Hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill), because you're continuously defering happiness until the next milestone (when I have `X` I'll be happy). Second, it also allocates success to the binary resolution of achieving it or not.
- Goals are at odds with long term progress: runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. In other words, people revert their habits once the goal has been accomplished.

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?

> Fall in love with the process rather than the product.

- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game.
- The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

## Changing The Wrong Thing — Identity

Change can happen at three layers:

- Outcomes: goals, what you get.
- Process: systems, what you do.
- Identity: what you believe.

As seen in the previous point, we shouldn't focus on what we want to achieve (outcomes-based), rather on who we wish to become (identity-based).

> The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes your identity.

Behind every system of action, there is a system of beliefs. Consequently, behavior that is not aligned with the self, won't last. If you want to create new habits, you need to change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.

If you want habits to stick in the long term, they have to become part of who you are. You are not the person who "WANTS" or "DOES", you are the person who "IS".

> The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity behind that behavior.

“Identity” derives from the Latin “essentitas” which means _being_, and “identidem”, which means _repeatedly_.

Define what you want to be, who you wish to become, then be the type of person that could get the outcome you want.
