> Monsieur de Norpois was not lying. He had just forgotten. One forgets rather quickly what one has not thought about with depth, what has been dictated to you by imitation, by the passions surrounding you.

In this line from Marcel Proust's novel [In Search of Lost Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time) (later referenced in [Fooled By Randomness](/blog/2019/fooled-by-randomness)), Monsieur de Norpois is made to be ashamed of the fact that he expressed a different opinion.

Opinion change can be sometimes considered a weakness or liability. Which I found surprising, since it remains the basis of inductive reasoning, thus the foundation for the formulation of modern science.

I change of opinion rather often, and I still feel insecure when it comes to step back, course correct or hesitate about previously held beliefs.

In particular, there is a certain type of opinion change that worries me the most — if we were to frame the problem from as a cost-benefit analysis. I'm referring to what is popularly known as "escalation of commitment". Which, in short, means keeping on investing in past decisions based on cumulative prior investment, despite the fact that new evidence suggests your resources would be more wisely allocated in another place.

True for product decisions, finance, personal relationships... You've invested so much in something that the cost of "killing it" is preventing you from turning around and making the right decision.

Now put escalation of commitment and the societal rejection coming from opinion change together, add a little bit of insecurity to the mix, and you've got yourself the perfect combination to lose focus of what's important.

—— Heard somewhere

I don't know where or when I've heard this quote, but it truly captures (in a subtle software development fashion) this idea. Making sure we are allocating the time in the relevant, high-impact endeavors, rather than pouring endless resources, because we said so in the past, to stuff that is barely moving the needle.

During the lasts two or three months this sensation has been, more than ever, unpleasantly acute. As a byproduct of feeling particularly sharp and energetic I committed to way too many things. [Running a marathon in less than 3 hours](/blog/2018/going-sub3), [reading one book per week](/blog/2019/upgrading-books), [building cloud computing for the mind](/work/pansa/), [keep developing Udacity projects](/blog/2018/magis-10)... and on top of that, of course, working as a Product Manager at Ironhack and sleeping (at least) seven hours — because this is what humans also do, sleep.

It sounds like I was doing a lot, but know what? I will recall this firsts months of the year as one of the most unproductive times of my life. Spread so thin across too many projects, sometimes I found myself blocked, distracted, without focus, not knowing where to go next. A specially frustrating concern coming from somebody whom "prioritization" constitutes a great deal of his daily job and also sports an uncanny obsession around efficiency and productivity.

> Guide your decisions by how much of it is motivated by not wanting to disappoint people and what my future 80-year-old would think about it.

I wonder how many decisions would be reconsidered after being analyzed through this lens. At least, it made me think of several things I had committed to that were not adding a significant amount of value and I was only doing because I didn't want to (or thought it would) let somebody down.

This post, besides serving as a healthy personal exercise around prioritization and help me regain focus in life, will serve as the sunsetting announcement for both the Magis and Sub3 projects.

Both with completely different reasons why behind (the one for Sub3 is separately discussed here), putting an end to them felt as a pure relieve — which also reassured me that I was making the right decision.

This was specially true in the case of Magis, which was a "spin-off" for one of the [Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree](/blog/2018/udacity-rdnd). [As much as I love coding](/blog/2019/right-time) and the joy I get out of creating stuff, Magis was a self-imposed project, misaligned with all other priorities that was being maintained just for the sake of "making". Unlike pansa or collado.io, it had no purpose or vision for the future.

And while it is true that it has served me well as a playground for trying new technologies and features before rolling them out to other projects of mine, there are more efficient ways to achieve the same outcome.

This is a strange article. I know. But long story short, it serves me as a sanity check to reset my priorities and get out of an unproductive situation; (I hope) it serves you to learn something about prioritization and changing opinion; and ultimately, it serves as the official announcement to sunset both Magis and Sub3 projects. Which truth be told, after writing these words I just realized that nobody cares.

Probably the most relevant take away of this piece.
