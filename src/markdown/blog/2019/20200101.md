ℹ️ If you are more into podcasts, check out the audio (and extended) version of this post in our [first episode of 2020](/work/radio-lanza/episodes/20). On top of that, keep in mind this post is also the natural extension of the [2019 retrospective](/blog/2019/retrospective). Which, in itself, was the audio, TL;DR version of [the last episode of 2019](/work/radio-lanza/episodes/19), where Jimmy and I put together our personal reviews of the closing year. And yes, that was quite a lot of resolution follow up!

This post also changes the 4-month Now schedule pattern (early, mid, late) seen in past editions, in favor of a one-off Now, published at the beginning of each year. As progress is being made, the items across resolutions will be properly updated. By the end of the year I also plan in releasing a retrospective, similar to [this one I wrote for 2019](/blog/2019/retrospective).
